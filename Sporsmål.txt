1. Why does the following expression 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3 evaluate to false in Javascript?

Most programming languages is based on the IEEE 754 standard. One reason 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3 = false is a consequence of the floating point math programming languages is using. When calculating 0.1 + 0.2 and printing ut to the console with javascript, the output is 0.30000000000000004.
